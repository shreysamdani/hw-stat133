## 2. Data Import:
```{r}
library(readr)

col_name <- c('symboling','normalized_losses', 'make', 'fuel_type', 'aspiration','num_of_doors','body_style', 'drive_wheels','engine_location','wheel_base', 'length','width','height','curb_weight','engine_type','num_of_cylinders','engine_size','fuel_system','bore','stroke','compression_ratio','horsepower','peak_rpm','city_mpg','highway_mpg','price')

col_type <- c('integer','real',rep('character',7),rep('real',4),'integer',rep('character',2),'real','character',rep('real',3),rep('integer',5))

data1 = read.csv(
  'imports-85.data',
  col.names = col_name,
  colClasses = col_type,
  sep = ",",
  na.strings = '?'
)
str(data1)

data2 = read_csv(
  'imports-85.data',
  col_names = col_name,
  col_types = "idcccccccddddiccdcdddiiiii",
  na = '?'
)

str(data2)
```
## 3. Technical Questions about importing data
1. If you don’t provide a vector of column names, what happens to the column names of
the imported data when you simply invoke read.csv('imports-85.data')?  
The column names are automatically generated based on the first item in the columns.

2. If you don’t provide a vector of column names, what happens to the column names of the
imported data when you invoke read.csv('imports-85.data', header = FALSE)?  
The columns get automatically in numerical order (V1, V2, V3...).

3. When using the reading table functions, if you don’t specify how missing values are
codified, what happens to the data type of those columns that contain '?', e.g. price
or num_of_doors?  
If the data type is not character, then the read table functions will fail to read. Otherwise it will read as a character/string.  

4. Say you import imports-85.data in two different ways. In the first option you import
the data without specifying the data type of each column. In the second option you do
specify the data types. You may wonder whether both options return a data frame of
the same memory size. You can actually use the function object.size() that provides
an estimate of the memory that is being used to store an R object. Why is the data
frame imported in the second option bigger (in terms of bytes) than the data frame
imported in the first option?  
There are certain column types which are specified as integers in the first option but doubles in the second. Since doubles take up more memory, the second option would be bigger.

5. Say the object dat is the data frame produced when importing imports-85.data.
What happens to the data values if you convert dat as an R matrix?
The data frame becomes a matrix with one column and a row for each column. This row contains the type of its respective column and the number of elements in that column.

## 4. Practice base plotting 
#### histogram of price with colored bars.
```{r histogram}
price <- data1[,c('price')]
hist(x = price, col = 'blue')
```


Clearly, there is a much bigger frequency of cheaper cars (around 10000) than expensive cars. The resulting histogram is skewed to the right.

#### boxplot of horsepower in horizontal orientation.
```{r boxplot}
horsepower <- data1[,c('horsepower')]
boxplot(x = horsepower, horizontal = TRUE)

```

The median horsepower lies at around 100, with quartiles at around 75 and 125. Most of the other values fall within the range of around 50 and 190. There are also 4 outliers with horsepowers greater than 200. 
  
  
#### barplot of the frequencies of body_style, arranged in decreasing order.
```{r barplot}
body_style <- sort(table(data1[,c('body_style')]), decreasing = TRUE)
barplot(height = body_style)

```
  
  Sedans and hatchbacks are the most frequently occurring cars, followed by wagons, hardtops, and convertibles.
  
  
#### stars() plot of vehicles with turbo aspiration, using only variables wheel-base,length, width, height, and price.
```{r stars}
library(dplyr)
x <- select(filter(data1, aspiration == 'turbo'), wheel_base, length, width, height)
stars(x)
```

Based on the star plot, it seems that the proportion of wheel_base, length, width, height are generally constant. The wheel_base and width are also more frequently of higher value than the other variables. The actual proportions for each turbo vehicle varies.

b. What is the make of the car with twelve num_of_cylinders?  
jaguar

c. What is the make that has the most diesel cars?  
Peugot

36000

e. What is the bottom 10th percentile of city_mpg?  
17

f. What is the top 10th percentile of highway_mpg?  
38

g. What is the median price of those cars in the bottom 10th percentile of city_mpg?

```{r}
# a
summarise(
  filter(data1, fuel_type == 'gas'),
  mean = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)
)
summarise(
  filter(data1, fuel_type == 'diesel'),
  mean = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)
)

#b
filter(data1, num_of_cylinders == 'twelve')

#c
dat <- 
  arrange(
    mutate(
      group_by(filter(data1, fuel_type == 'diesel'), make), 
    count= n()), 
  desc(count))

head(dat,1)

#d
dat <- select(arrange(data1, desc(horsepower)),price)
head(dat, 5)

#e
quantile(data1[,c("city_mpg")],0.1, na.rm = TRUE)

#f
quantile(data1[,c("highway_mpg")],0.9, na.rm = TRUE)

#g
quant  =  quantile(data1[,c("city_mpg")],0.1, na.rm = TRUE)
dat <- select(filter(data1,city_mpg <= unname(quant)), price)
quantile(dat, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE)

```

## 6. Technical Questions about data frames

a. What happens when you use the dollar $ operator on a data frame, attempting to use
the name of a column that does not exist? For example: dat$xyz where there is no
column named xyz.  
It will return NULL.

b. Which of the following commands fails to return the vector mpg which is a column in
the built-in data rfame mtcars:  
1. mtcars$mpg  
2. mtcars[ ,1]  
3. mtcars[[1]]  
4. mtcars[ ,mpg]  < WILL FAIL
5. mtcars[["mpg"]]  
6. mtcars$"mpg"  
7. mtcars[ ,"mpg"]  

c. Based on your answer for part (b), what is the reason that makes such command to
fail?  
There is no object called mpg; the column name is the string 'mpg'.

d. Can you include an R list as a “column” of a data frame? YES or NO, and why.  
YES; the command [data frame]$[column name] <- [list] will add the column, as long as the number of rows matches up.

e. What happens when you apply as.list() to a data frame? e.g. as.list(mtcars)  
A nested list will be returned (subscript once to get a column, subscript twice to get the row from that column).

f. Consider the command: abc <- as.list(mtcars). What function(s) can you use to
convert the object abc into a data frame?  
data.frame(abc)

## 7. Correlations of quantitative variables
```{r correlations}
library(corrplot)
qdat <- select_if(na.omit(data1), is.numeric)
qdat$symboling <- NULL
qdat$normalized_losses <- NULL
M <- cor(qdat)
```

```{r corrplot1}
corrplot(M, method = 'color')
```
```{r corrplot2}
corrplot(M, method = 'circle')
```

Based on the correlograms, there are few main patterns that can be observed. The first is that there is a strong correlation between the size features of the auto (wheel_base, length ... bore). The second is that the size and the mpg are highly uncorrelated. The city_mpg and highway_mpg are also strongly correlated with each other. The price and horsepower are also positively correlated with the size, showing that bigger cars seem to cost more. It also implies that more expensive cars have worse mpg but more horsepower. Everything else is insignificant and relatively uncorrelated.


## 8. Principal Components Analysis
### Run PCA
```{r}
pca_prcomp <- prcomp(qdat, scale = TRUE)

eigenvalues <- pca_prcomp$sdev^2
percentage = 100* eigenvalues / sum(eigenvalues)
cumulative = cumsum(percentage)

proportion = data.frame(eigenvalues, percentage, cumulative)
proportion

```

Based on the table, 55.6% of the variation is captured by the first component, 70.1% by the first two, and 79.6% by the first 3.

### PCA plot of vehicles, and PCA plot of variables
```{r}
pc1 <- pca_prcomp$x[,'PC1']
pc2 <- pca_prcomp$x[,'PC2']
plot(pc1,pc2, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```
```{r}
PC1 <- pca_prcomp$rotation[1:14]
PC2 <- pca_prcomp$rotation[15:28]
plot(PC1,PC2, type = 'n')
text(PC1,PC2, names(qdat), cex = 0.8, col = 'red')
arrows(0,0,PC1,PC2, col = 'red')
```
```{r}
biplot(pca_prcomp)

```

The scatterplot between PC1 and PC2 shows no real correlation, implying that the variables are not completely correlated to each other and are almost independent if looked at as a whole. The second graph shows that most of the arrows are long, implying a high correlation coefficient. This means that the PCs are relatively accurate representation of the correlation between the variables.
